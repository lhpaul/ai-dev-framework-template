## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow`: Added automated reviewer loop to `protocols/90-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` (Step 8). The orchestrator polls for feedback after every push, dispatches the appropriate fixing agent when blocking issues are found, and escalates to human after timeout or 3 fix cycles. Updated Steps 1, 2, 6, and 7 for consistency.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/pr-review-platform.md`: New platform-agnostic integration doc defining what any automated code review tool must provide and what each platform-specific integration doc must specify. Mirrors the `issue-tracker.md` / `linear.md` pattern.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/greptile.md`: Added Greptile-specific Step 8 implementation (bot identity, re-trigger command, review completion detection, inline comment fetch). Generic loop mechanics remain in the protocol; only tool-specific commands live here.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow`: Added `Spec In Review` and `Plan In Review` stages to the workflow. These stages make PR-open states explicit so the orchestrator agent knows not to re-dispatch when a spec or plan PR is already awaiting human review. Updated `README.md` (stage diagram, issue tracker status list, Agent Roles Summary table) and `protocols/90-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` (mental map, eligibility table, pre-dispatch branch check).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- Sync-template workflow now stores template source config in `.tmp/template-config.json` (framework-agnostic, gitignored) instead of `.claude/template-config.json`. Single source for Claude Code remains `.claude/skills/sync-template.md`; Cursor uses `.cursor/commands/sync-template.md`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `.claude/commands/code-review.md` — new pipeline for automated PR reviews using parallel Claude agents and confidence scoring.

### Changed

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/04-review-implemented-development-protocol.md` — updated implementation review protocol to include Step 2 (Run code-review command) and improved section navigation with an explicit Flow Overview.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `.claude/agents/smoke-tester.md` — missing Claude Code sub-agent for the smoke test stage; delegates execution to `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/05-smoke-test-protocol.md` and `docs/testing/README.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/05-smoke-test-protocol.md` — new agnostic smoke test execution protocol with a two-path decision (run committed spec if it exists, fall back to ad-hoc script), standard output format, pass criteria, and fail handling rules. References the project testing README for all project-specific details.
- `docs/testing/README.md` — template for the project-specific smoke test execution guide: decision tree, committed suite path, ad-hoc fallback scaffold (Node.js + Playwright example), selector/waiting conventions, and troubleshooting sections for projects to fill in during setup.
- Testing Strategy section in `docs/project/3-software-architecture.md` — placeholder documenting the two-tier model (committed automated suite as primary path, ad-hoc scripts as stepping stone), the runbook-to-spec relationship, and setup instructions.

### Changed

- `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md` — testing strategy ownership moved to `docs/project/3-software-architecture.md`; this file now points there and focuses on principles and conventions only. Added two-tier execution model note and link to `docs/testing/README.md` in the Smoke Tests section.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/04-implement-development-protocol.md` — Step 5 now includes an explicit e2e spec maintenance instruction (keep committed specs in sync; create one when adding a feature with a runbook). Step 6 pre-commit verification separates unit/integration tests from the e2e suite command. Fast Track path updated accordingly.
- Refactored issue tracker integration protocols to remove redundant field definitions and fallback logic.
- Centralized "current brief" definitions and agent expectations in `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/issue-tracker.md`.
- Updated `Spec Ready`, `Plan Ready`, and `In Development` protocols to delegate issue-tracker-specific logic to the centralized source.

### Fixed

- Updated all Cursor slash commands to use the correct `/` prefix (replacing incorrect `@` prefix) in all documentation, command descriptions, and protocols.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `.claude/skills/sync-template.md` — Claude Code skill (`/sync-template`) to sync framework updates from the upstream template into a downstream project; compares files, shows a categorized diff, applies changes only after explicit approval, and generates ready-to-use git instructions
- `.cursor/commands/sync-template.md` — Cursor equivalent (`/sync-template`) with identical behaviour
- `.claude/skills/` added to the list of framework-level paths to propagate in `README.md`
- "Maintenance Commands" table in `AGENTS.md` documenting `/sync-template` and `/sync-template`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-24

### Refactored

- Moved `docs/ai/agent-model-config.md` to `docs/ai/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md` for better repository organization.
- Updated documentation links in `AGENTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the new path for `agent-model-config.md`.

### Changed

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md` — Updated the development lifecycle diagram to specify the `develop` branch as the merge target.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md` — documents model assignments, tool restrictions, and override instructions for all Claude Code agents
- Link to `agent-model-config.md` in the Key Documentation table in `AGENTS.md`

### Changed

- All Claude Code agents (`.claude/agents/`) now declare an explicit `model` field in their YAML frontmatter:
  - `tech-lead` → `claude-opus-4-6` (highest-reasoning stage; architecture decisions benefit from Opus depth)
  - `developer`, `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, `implementation-plan-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `project-setup` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (capable and cost-effective for their respective tasks)
  - `orchestrator` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (mechanical dispatch work; speed and cost matter at orchestration frequency)
- `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, and `implementation-plan-reviewer` agents: `Bash` removed from `tools` (least-privilege — these agents only read and write documentation files)
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/90-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` Step 5: expanded with explicit parallel subagent dispatch instructions — the orchestrator now uses the Claude Code `Task` tool to launch all eligible agents simultaneously in a single message rather than sequentially
- AI development workflow: clarified the Spec Ready stage is product-focused and technical design details belong in the Plan Ready stage.

### Removed

- Framework sync scripts (manual propagation/backporting only).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Issue tracker branch naming convention: when an issue tracker is in use, branch slugs are prefixed with the issue identifier (e.g., `feature/ENG-123-user-auth`); without a tracker the existing slug convention applies. Documented in `docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md`, `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md`, all three development protocols, and `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md`

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` — Git & Branching and CHANGELOG sections updated with project-specific overrides: no `develop` branch (all PRs target `main`), and every merged PR releases a new version
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` — fixed broken Markdown in placeholder table: replaced nested-bracket links with backtick paths and an inline example for the setup agent

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Staged AI-assisted development workflow (Spec → Plan → Implement → Review → Release) with 8 protocol documents in `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/`
- Claude Code agents for all workflow stages (`.claude/agents/`): `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, `tech-lead`, `implementation-plan-reviewer`, `developer`, `code-reviewer`, `orchestrator`, `project-setup`
- Cursor commands and rules (`.cursor/`) mirroring the full Claude Code workflow
- Project setup onboarding agent (`docs/ai/setup/protocol.md`) — 12-step structured conversation to generate all project-specific documentation
- Project documentation placeholders (`docs/project/`): business domain, repo architecture, software architecture, database model
- General best practices: coding standards (`1-general.md`), version control (`2-version-control.md`), testing (`3-testing.md`)
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` as a coordinator document — provides stack summary, quick reference, and links to `docs/best-practices/stack/[technology].md` detail files generated by the setup agent per technology area
- Optional integrations for Linear and Greptile (`docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/`)
- Spec, implementation plan, and smoke test runbook templates (`docs/ai/development-workflow/templates/`)
- `AGENTS.md` as the universal AI entry point (AGENTS.md open format), with `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` symlinks for Claude Code and Gemini CLI compatibility
- `.claude/settings.json` with pre-approved permissions for common git and fetch operations; `.claude/settings.local.json.example` documenting machine-specific overrides for optional integrations
- `.gitignore` covering local Claude settings, `.env` files, and common system files

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `pr-review-loop.sh`: Devin adapter now counts GitHub Status Contexts (in addition to Check Runs) when detecting Devin review activity and completion, preventing false `no_check_run` skips when Devin signals via a commit status instead of a check run. Status counts are deduplicated by context (latest entry per context) to avoid inflated counts when the same context transitions through multiple states.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- New Claude Code slash commands: `/run-item-work` (single-item workflow orchestration, mirrors Cursor), `/run-reviewer-loop` (automated reviewer + CI loop, mirrors Cursor), and `/post-merge-cleanup` (post-merge branch cleanup and issue tracker update, mirrors Cursor). All three are now autocompleted in Claude Code and listed as the primary entry points in the CLAUDE.md workflow table.
- Pre-flight check for existing unresolved review findings in `/run-reviewer-loop` (Claude Code and Cursor): before running the review scripts, the agent now inspects existing PR reviews for blocking findings posted by configured platforms after a previous run timed out, and dispatches a fixer first. Protocol 92 updated to document this step.
- Automated issue ledger tracking for PR review loops: the `automated-reviewer-loop` agent now maintains an issue ledger across cycles, keyed by `(platform, path, body_snippet)` to survive line shifts. After each fixer push, agents post a fix-commit comment listing resolved vs. remaining issues. When the loop terminates, agents post a final summary table with resolution status and commit SHAs.
- Devin review state expansion: `pr-review-loop.sh` now treats `COMMENTED`-state reviews from Devin as blocking findings (previously only `CHANGES_REQUESTED` was captured). This ensures out-of-diff findings posted by Devin are surfaced in the review loop.
- Protocol 90 blocking classification documentation: updated "Blocking vs. suggestion classification" section to clarify that both `CHANGES_REQUESTED` and `COMMENTED` reviews are treated as blocking.

### Fixed

- `pr-review-loop.sh`: Devin adapter now returns `skipped` instead of polling until timeout when no Devin check run exists for the HEAD commit. Subsequent pushes to an already-reviewed PR often have no check run, causing spurious timeouts and escalations.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Devin automated PR review adapter: `pr-review-loop.sh` now supports `--platform devin`, polling Devin check runs for completion and collecting inline findings. Added `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/devin.md` with setup, bot identity, and adapter contract details.
- Workflow config file (`.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`): declares which review platforms are active for the repository. `pr-review-loop.sh` reads this file automatically when no `--platform` flag is passed, replacing the hardcoded `greptile` default. The project setup protocol generates this file during onboarding.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- Workflow-next-action: `--development` mode now discovers spec and implementation-plan files with either `.md` or `.doc.md` suffixes (`1_*_specs.md` / `1_*_specs.doc.md` and `2_*_implementation-plan.md` / `2_*_implementation-plan.doc.md`), taking the first match so Cursor/Notion-style doc filenames are supported without requiring a single canonical pattern.
- Prepare-release protocol: added instructions for updating reference-style link definitions in `CHANGELOG.md` so version headers remain clickable comparison links on GitHub; retain existing definitions and use the same tag format as CI (e.g. `v1.2.0`).
- Sync-template: project-specific files are now "review for additive updates" instead of "never touch". The agent compares template vs project and may propose adding template improvements while preserving project-specific content; differences are classified as optional additive updates. Step 3 summary, Step 4 apply rules, and PR description wording updated in the sync-template skill/command.
- Auto-tag-release workflow: upgraded `actions/checkout` from v4 to v5; refactored release notes extraction to use a variable and improved clarity (version stripping and awk escaping for CHANGELOG section matching).

- Review workflow: `REVIEW.md` is now the canonical review contract for spec, plan, and code review gates. Claude Code and Codex now default to native review flows against `REVIEW.md`, Cursor review commands explicitly follow the same contract, and the old review-stage protocols are reduced to compatibility wrappers.
- Automated PR review: `pr-review-loop.sh` and the workflow docs now support ordered multi-platform review loops. Review platforms run sequentially, all gating platforms must be clean or skipped before `ready-for-human-review`, and unsupported adapters such as the planned Devin integration are documented explicitly.
- Workflow orchestration is now split into two supporting protocols: `90-batch-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` for portfolio-level discovery, batching, dispatch, and supervision, and `91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` for single-item orchestration through reviewer/PR/CI readiness. Added `workflow-batch-plan.sh`, `workflow-item-orchestrator` wrappers for Codex/Cursor/Claude, and updated docs so `workflow-orchestrator` / `/run-work` remain the portfolio-wide entrypoint while targeted resume/advance uses the new item-orchestrator path.

### Fixed

- Claude Code orchestrator agents: added the `Agent` tool to `orchestrator`, `item-orchestrator`, and `automated-reviewer-loop` so they can dispatch sub-agents (developer, code-reviewer, etc.) instead of running all stages inline in a single session.
- pr-review-loop.sh: existing-findings path now correctly counts and reports existing soft-suggestion comments; COMMENT_COUNT and SUGGESTION_COUNT were previously undercounting.
- pr-review-loop.sh: fallback date when neither BSD nor GNU date is available now uses epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) instead of current time, so all comments are considered rather than none.
- sync-template: include `.cursor/agents/` in the Always sync list so `/sync-template` detects and propagates Cursor agent files; aligns with README framework-level propagation paths.

### Added

- Smoke tester agent: added `smoke-tester` to the AGENTS.md workflow commands table and `agent-model-config.md` (tier assignment, per-agent model recommendations, and tool restrictions) to complete documentation coverage for the smoke test stage.
- Cursor subagents: workflow agents (orchestrator, developer, tech-lead, etc.) are now defined in `.cursor/agents/` with per-agent model selection (`fast`, `inherit`, or specific model ID). Orchestration protocol and `agent-model-config.md` document how to execute with Cursor subagents and override models.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Workflow status derivation: `workflow-next-action.sh --development` now infers the current workflow stage from repo state (presence of implementation plan file, feature branch) instead of requiring a `**Status**` line in the spec file. When an issue tracker (e.g. Linear) is the source of truth, the spec file's status field is optional. Updated protocols (01-review-specs, 02-generate-implementation-plan, 02-review-implementation-plan, 04-implement-development, 04-review-implemented-development, 90-orchestrate-work) and `integrations/linear.md` to document the tracker-as-source-of-truth model.
- Post-merge cleanup: the agent now updates the related issue in the issue tracker after running the cleanup script. When the merged branch name contains an issue identifier (e.g. `ENG-123`), the skill/command instructs the agent to set that issue to the merged/done state (e.g. Linear → **Merged**). See `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md` and the post-merge-cleanup skill/command docs.

### Fixed

- Reviewer loop: `pr-review-loop.sh` now checks for existing blocking findings from the bot (e.g. from a review that already ran on PR open) before posting a new trigger. If any exist, it reports `needs_fixes` and exits without triggering so the fixer addresses them first; avoids triggering a new review and ignoring issues already raised. Protocol 92 is now a thin wrapper (scope + follow 90) with no duplicated Step 7/8 procedure.

### Added

- Standalone automated reviewer loop: new protocol `93-automated-reviewer-loop-protocol.md`, Cursor command `/run-reviewer-loop`, Claude Code agent `automated-reviewer-loop`, and Codex skill `workflow-reviewer-loop`. Run the automated reviewer and CI loop for a specific PR (or current branch's PR) until ready for human review or escalated, without full orchestration.
- Post-merge cleanup: `scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh` plus `/post-merge-cleanup` for Cursor and Claude Code and `post-merge-cleanup` Codex skill. After a development PR is merged and the remote branch deleted, fetches origin, checks out develop, pulls, and deletes the local branch to keep the repo clean.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- Implementation plans now explicitly consider project documentation in `docs/`: generate-plan protocol and template require listing doc updates (or "None" with justification), and plan review checks that docs were considered ([#25](https://github.com/lhpaul/ai-dev-framework-template/issues/25)).

### Added

- Workflow helper scripts: `scripts/greptile-review-loop.sh`, `scripts/pr-ci-loop.sh`, `scripts/workflow-next-action.sh`, and `scripts/workflow-lib.sh` so any AI agent or human can deterministically inspect state, poll automated review, and poll CI.

### Changed

- Workflow scripts moved into `scripts/development-workflow/` so template workflow helpers are separate from scripts that downstream repositories add (e.g. `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/deploy.sh`). All references in docs, AGENTS.md, and skills updated to the new paths.
- AI workflow protocols now treat creator stages as subroutines instead of terminal steps: spec, plan, and implementation runs continue through reviewer gate, PR creation, automated review, and CI until they are actually waiting on a human or escalated.
- Orchestration guidance across Codex skills, Claude agents, Cursor commands, `README.md`, and `AGENTS.md` now defines a persistent control loop with explicit terminal conditions instead of stopping after the next stage finishes.
- Claude agent tool restrictions now allow spec and plan stage agents to use `Bash` when needed for branch creation, commits, pushes, and PR readiness loops.
- Workflow docs now describe the optional GitHub Actions + Codex runtime needed for truly background Greptile fix loops.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

- AI workflow: add a reviewer-agent gate before opening PRs for spec, plan, and implementation stages (so automated PR review tools run only after reviewer approval).
- AI workflow: keep the template's `develop` integration branch + `main` releases, and enforce the reviewer gate before opening PRs.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- `scripts/README.md` documenting the purpose and usage of each helper script in the `scripts/` directory.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- `.codex/skills/` workflow skills for Codex (`workflow-project-setup`, `workflow-spec-writer`, `workflow-spec-reviewer`, `workflow-plan-writer`, `workflow-plan-reviewer`, `workflow-implementer`, `workflow-code-reviewer`, `workflow-orchestrator`) as thin wrappers over the existing protocol documents.
- `.codex/skills/*/agents/openai.yaml` metadata so downstream projects get human-friendly skill names, descriptions, and starter prompts in Codex-compatible UIs.
- `scripts/install-codex-skills.sh` to symlink the repository's Codex skills into the local Codex skill directory.
- `scripts/discover-workflow-state.sh` and `scripts/check-workflow-branch.sh` to give the orchestrator deterministic shell helpers for state discovery and branch/worktree checks.

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md` to document Codex skill usage and installation alongside the existing Claude Code and Cursor wrappers.
- `.codex/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `README.md` to document recommended model tiers for each Codex skill, with `workflow-orchestrator` positioned as the default `economy` entrypoint.
- `README.md` to include copy-paste starter examples for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex users testing the orchestration flow in downstream repositories.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md` to use "default integration branch" wording where the template previously hard-coded `develop`, so repository-level branch overrides in `AGENTS.md` remain consistent.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` to document the Codex helper scripts and Codex-specific execution behavior while preserving the shared orchestration protocol.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/05-prepare-release-protocol.md` — authoritative release protocol: pre-flight checks, versioning guidance, CHANGELOG update, two-PR approach (main + mandatory develop backport), and CI auto-tagging note.
- `.claude/commands/prepare-release.md` — Claude Code `/prepare-release` command (thin wrapper delegating to the new protocol).
- `.github/workflows/auto-tag-release.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that automatically creates a git tag and GitHub release when a `release/*` PR is merged into `main`. Extracts the version from the branch name and release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- `.cursor/commands/prepare-release.md` — refactored to thin wrapper delegating to `05-prepare-release-protocol.md`; previously had inline steps.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md` — Release Process section replaced with a summary and link to the new protocol.
- `AGENTS.md` — Prepare Release row now lists `/prepare-release` for Claude Code (was `—`) and references the protocol in the "Any other tool" column.
- `.claude/skills/sync-template.md` — added `.claude/commands/` to always-sync paths; added `.github/workflows/auto-tag-release.yml` to special-handling paths.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow`: Added automated reviewer loop to `protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` (Step 8). The orchestrator polls for feedback after every push, dispatches the appropriate fixing agent when blocking issues are found, and escalates to human after timeout or 3 fix cycles. Updated Steps 1, 2, 6, and 7 for consistency.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/pr-review-platform.md`: New platform-agnostic integration doc defining what any automated code review tool must provide and what each platform-specific integration doc must specify. Mirrors the `issue-tracker.md` / `linear.md` pattern.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/greptile.md`: Added Greptile-specific Step 8 implementation (bot identity, re-trigger command, review completion detection, inline comment fetch). Generic loop mechanics remain in the protocol; only tool-specific commands live here.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow`: Added `Spec In Review` and `Plan In Review` stages to the workflow. These stages make PR-open states explicit so the orchestrator agent knows not to re-dispatch when a spec or plan PR is already awaiting human review. Updated `README.md` (stage diagram, issue tracker status list, Agent Roles Summary table) and `protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` (mental map, eligibility table, pre-dispatch branch check).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- Sync-template workflow now stores template source config in `.tmp/template-config.json` (framework-agnostic, gitignored) instead of `.claude/template-config.json`. Single source for Claude Code remains `.claude/skills/sync-template.md`; Cursor uses `.cursor/commands/sync-template.md`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `.claude/commands/code-review.md` — new pipeline for automated PR reviews using parallel Claude agents and confidence scoring.

### Changed

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/03-review-implementation-protocol.md` — updated implementation review protocol to include Step 2 (Run code-review command) and improved section navigation with an explicit Flow Overview.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- `.claude/agents/smoke-tester.md` — missing Claude Code sub-agent for the smoke test stage; delegates execution to `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/04-smoke-test-protocol.md` and `docs/testing/README.md`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/04-smoke-test-protocol.md` — new agnostic smoke test execution protocol with a two-path decision (run committed spec if it exists, fall back to ad-hoc script), standard output format, pass criteria, and fail handling rules. References the project testing README for all project-specific details.
- `docs/testing/README.md` — template for the project-specific smoke test execution guide: decision tree, committed suite path, ad-hoc fallback scaffold (Node.js + Playwright example), selector/waiting conventions, and troubleshooting sections for projects to fill in during setup.
- Testing Strategy section in `docs/project/3-software-architecture.md` — placeholder documenting the two-tier model (committed automated suite as primary path, ad-hoc scripts as stepping stone), the runbook-to-spec relationship, and setup instructions.

### Changed

- `docs/best-practices/3-testing.md` — testing strategy ownership moved to `docs/project/3-software-architecture.md`; this file now points there and focuses on principles and conventions only. Added two-tier execution model note and link to `docs/testing/README.md` in the Smoke Tests section.
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/03-implement-development-protocol.md` — Step 5 now includes an explicit e2e spec maintenance instruction (keep committed specs in sync; create one when adding a feature with a runbook). Step 6 pre-commit verification separates unit/integration tests from the e2e suite command. Fast Track path updated accordingly.
- Refactored issue tracker integration protocols to remove redundant field definitions and fallback logic.
- Centralized "current brief" definitions and agent expectations in `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/issue-tracker.md`.
- Updated `Spec Ready`, `Plan Ready`, and `In Development` protocols to delegate issue-tracker-specific logic to the centralized source.

### Fixed

- Updated all Cursor slash commands to use the correct `/` prefix (replacing incorrect `@` prefix) in all documentation, command descriptions, and protocols.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `.claude/skills/sync-template.md` — Claude Code skill (`/sync-template`) to sync framework updates from the upstream template into a downstream project; compares files, shows a categorized diff, applies changes only after explicit approval, and generates ready-to-use git instructions
- `.cursor/commands/sync-template.md` — Cursor equivalent (`/sync-template`) with identical behaviour
- `.claude/skills/` added to the list of framework-level paths to propagate in `README.md`
- "Maintenance Commands" table in `AGENTS.md` documenting `/sync-template` and `/sync-template`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-24

### Refactored

- Moved `docs/ai/agent-model-config.md` to `docs/ai/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md` for better repository organization.
- Updated documentation links in `AGENTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the new path for `agent-model-config.md`.

### Changed

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md` — Updated the development lifecycle diagram to specify the `develop` branch as the merge target.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `docs/ai/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md` — documents model assignments, tool restrictions, and override instructions for all Claude Code agents
- Link to `agent-model-config.md` in the Key Documentation table in `AGENTS.md`

### Changed

- All Claude Code agents (`.claude/agents/`) now declare an explicit `model` field in their YAML frontmatter:
  - `tech-lead` → `claude-opus-4-6` (highest-reasoning stage; architecture decisions benefit from Opus depth)
  - `developer`, `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, `implementation-plan-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `project-setup` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (capable and cost-effective for their respective tasks)
  - `orchestrator` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (mechanical dispatch work; speed and cost matter at orchestration frequency)
- `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, and `implementation-plan-reviewer` agents: `Bash` removed from `tools` (least-privilege — these agents only read and write documentation files)
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` Step 5: expanded with explicit parallel subagent dispatch instructions — the orchestrator now uses the Claude Code `Task` tool to launch all eligible agents simultaneously in a single message rather than sequentially
- AI development workflow: clarified the Spec Ready stage is product-focused and technical design details belong in the Plan Ready stage.

### Removed

- Framework sync scripts (manual propagation/backporting only).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Issue tracker branch naming convention: when an issue tracker is in use, branch slugs are prefixed with the issue identifier (e.g., `feature/ENG-123-user-auth`); without a tracker the existing slug convention applies. Documented in `docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md`, `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md`, all three development protocols, and `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md`

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` — Git & Branching and CHANGELOG sections updated with project-specific overrides: no `develop` branch (all PRs target `main`), and every merged PR releases a new version
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` — fixed broken Markdown in placeholder table: replaced nested-bracket links with backtick paths and an inline example for the setup agent

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Staged AI-assisted development workflow (Spec → Plan → Implement → Review → Release) with 8 protocol documents in `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/`
- Claude Code agents for all workflow stages (`.claude/agents/`): `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, `tech-lead`, `implementation-plan-reviewer`, `developer`, `code-reviewer`, `orchestrator`, `project-setup`
- Cursor commands and rules (`.cursor/`) mirroring the full Claude Code workflow
- Project setup onboarding agent (`docs/ai/setup/protocol.md`) — 12-step structured conversation to generate all project-specific documentation
- Project documentation placeholders (`docs/project/`): business domain, repo architecture, software architecture, database model
- General best practices: coding standards (`1-general.md`), version control (`2-version-control.md`), testing (`3-testing.md`)
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` as a coordinator document — provides stack summary, quick reference, and links to `docs/best-practices/stack/[technology].md` detail files generated by the setup agent per technology area
- Optional integrations for Linear and Greptile (`docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/`)
- Spec, implementation plan, and smoke test runbook templates (`docs/ai/development-workflow/templates/`)
- `AGENTS.md` as the universal AI entry point (AGENTS.md open format), with `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` symlinks for Claude Code and Gemini CLI compatibility
- `.claude/settings.json` with pre-approved permissions for common git and fetch operations; `.claude/settings.local.json.example` documenting machine-specific overrides for optional integrations
- `.gitignore` covering local Claude settings, `.env` files, and common system files

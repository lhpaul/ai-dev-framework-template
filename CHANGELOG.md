# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `docs/ai/agent-model-config.md` — documents model assignments, tool restrictions, and override instructions for all Claude Code agents
- Link to `agent-model-config.md` in the Key Documentation table in `AGENTS.md`

### Changed

- All Claude Code agents (`.claude/agents/`) now declare an explicit `model` field in their YAML frontmatter:
  - `tech-lead` → `claude-opus-4-6` (highest-reasoning stage; architecture decisions benefit from Opus depth)
  - `developer`, `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, `implementation-plan-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `project-setup` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` (capable and cost-effective for their respective tasks)
  - `orchestrator` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (mechanical dispatch work; speed and cost matter at orchestration frequency)
- `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, and `implementation-plan-reviewer` agents: `Bash` removed from `tools` (least-privilege — these agents only read and write documentation files)
- `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/90-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` Step 5: expanded with explicit parallel subagent dispatch instructions — the orchestrator now uses the Claude Code `Task` tool to launch all eligible agents simultaneously in a single message rather than sequentially
- AI development workflow: clarified the Spec Ready stage is product-focused and technical design details belong in the Plan Ready stage.

### Removed

- Framework sync scripts (manual propagation/backporting only).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Issue tracker branch naming convention: when an issue tracker is in use, branch slugs are prefixed with the issue identifier (e.g., `feature/ENG-123-user-auth`); without a tracker the existing slug convention applies. Documented in `docs/best-practices/2-version-control.md`, `docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md`, all three development protocols, and `docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/linear.md`

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` — Git & Branching and CHANGELOG sections updated with project-specific overrides: no `develop` branch (all PRs target `main`), and every merged PR releases a new version
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` — fixed broken Markdown in placeholder table: replaced nested-bracket links with backtick paths and an inline example for the setup agent

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Staged AI-assisted development workflow (Spec → Plan → Implement → Review → Release) with 8 protocol documents in `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/`
- Claude Code agents for all workflow stages (`.claude/agents/`): `product-manager`, `spec-reviewer`, `tech-lead`, `implementation-plan-reviewer`, `developer`, `code-reviewer`, `orchestrator`, `project-setup`
- Cursor commands and rules (`.cursor/`) mirroring the full Claude Code workflow
- Project setup onboarding agent (`docs/ai/setup/protocol.md`) — 12-step structured conversation to generate all project-specific documentation
- Project documentation placeholders (`docs/project/`): business domain, repo architecture, software architecture, database model
- General best practices: coding standards (`1-general.md`), version control (`2-version-control.md`), testing (`3-testing.md`)
- `docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md` as a coordinator document — provides stack summary, quick reference, and links to `docs/best-practices/stack/[technology].md` detail files generated by the setup agent per technology area
- Optional integrations for Linear and Greptile (`docs/ai/development-workflow/integrations/`)
- Spec, implementation plan, and smoke test runbook templates (`docs/ai/development-workflow/templates/`)
- `AGENTS.md` as the universal AI entry point (AGENTS.md open format), with `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` symlinks for Claude Code and Gemini CLI compatibility
- `.claude/settings.json` with pre-approved permissions for common git and fetch operations; `.claude/settings.local.json.example` documenting machine-specific overrides for optional integrations
- `.gitignore` covering local Claude settings, `.env` files, and common system files

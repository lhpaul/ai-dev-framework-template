## AI Development Workflow

This project follows a staged AI-assisted development workflow. The canonical reference is:

`docs/ai/development-workflow/README.md`

### Stages and protocols

| Stage | Protocol |
|---|---|
| Write spec | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/01-generate-specs-protocol.md` |
| Review spec | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/01-review-specs-protocol.md` |
| Write plan | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md` |
| Review plan | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/02-review-implementation-plan-protocol.md` |
| Implement | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/04-implement-development-protocol.md` |
| Review code | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/04-review-implemented-development-protocol.md` |
| Orchestrate | `docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/90-orchestrate-work-protocol.md` |

### Key rules

- Always read the spec and plan before implementing
- Never skip the approval gate before Git operations
- Always update CHANGELOG under `[Unreleased]` before opening a PR
- No `git push --force`, `reset --hard`, or rebase on shared branches without explicit human approval
- Humans merge PRs — agents open them

## Documentation Conventions

### Single source of truth

Every piece of information lives in exactly one place. Before adding content:
1. Check if it already exists somewhere in `docs/`
2. If it exists, reference it — don't duplicate it
3. If it doesn't exist, add it in the most appropriate file

### Document boundaries

| File/Directory | Contains |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Project overview, quick start, repo map |
| `AGENTS.md` | AI agent guidance, commands, key conventions |
| `docs/project/` | Project-specific context (domain, architecture, stack, DB) |
| `docs/best-practices/` | Coding standards and conventions |
| `docs/ai/development-workflow/` | Workflow protocols, templates, integrations |
| `docs/specs/developments/` | Feature specs and implementation plans |
| `docs/testing/` | Smoke test runbooks |

### Cross-referencing

Prefer references over duplication:

```markdown
<!-- Good -->
For database conventions, see [`docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md`](../best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md).

<!-- Bad -->
[Copying the entire database conventions section here]
```

### Placeholder discipline

- Use `> TODO: [specific question]` for content that needs to be filled in
- Never leave generic placeholder text (e.g., "[Description]") after setup is complete
- If a section doesn't apply to the project, delete it rather than leaving it empty

### Writing style

- Write for AI readers as well as humans — be specific and unambiguous
- Prefer tables over long prose for structured information
- Use code blocks for commands, file paths, and code examples
- Keep docs concise — AI agents read these on every task

Follow the implementation plan generation protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/ai/development-workflow/protocols/02-generate-implementation-plan-protocol.md`

Always read the approved spec and relevant codebase sections before proposing an approach. Do not skip the approval gate before writing the plan.

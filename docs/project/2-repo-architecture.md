## Overview

> Briefly describe the repository structure (monorepo, polyrepo, single app, etc.) and the rationale.

## Directory Structure

> Show the top-level structure and explain what each directory contains.

```
[repo-root]/
├── [directory-1]/    # [description]
├── [directory-2]/    # [description]

## Shared Packages / Libraries

> List shared packages/libraries with their purpose and consumers.

| Package | Purpose | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| [Package 1] | [Description] | [App 1, App 2] |

## Dependency Graph

> Optionally, show how packages/apps depend on each other.

```
[App 1] → [Package A]
[App 2] → [Package A], [Package B]
```

## Common Commands

> List the most important commands for development, build, test, and deploy.

```bash
# Install dependencies

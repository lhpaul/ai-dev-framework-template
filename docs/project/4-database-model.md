## Overview

> Describe the database engine, hosting, and general approach (e.g., single schema, multi-tenant, event-sourced).

## Schema Overview

> High-level diagram or table list showing main tables and their relationships.

```
[Table A] 1──N [Table B]
[Table B] N──N [Table C]  (via [join_table])
```

## Tables

> For each table, list its columns, types, constraints, and purpose.

### `[table_name]`

> [One-line description of what this table stores]

| Column | Type | Nullable | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | uuid | no | Primary key |
| `[column]` | [type] | [yes/no] | [Description] |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | no | Creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | no | Last update timestamp |

## Access Control

> Describe how data access is controlled (e.g., Row Level Security, application-level authorization, API gateway rules).

### Principles

- [Principle 1: e.g., users only access their own data]
- [Principle 2: e.g., role-based access to admin operations]

### Rules per Table

| Table | Who can read | Who can write | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[table]` | [rule] | [rule] | [notes] |

## Migrations

> How are schema changes managed?

```bash
# Create a new migration
[command]

# Apply migrations
[command]

# Reset local database
[command]
```

## Seed Data

> Describe what seed data exists and how to load it. Seed data should cover all scenarios, roles, and statuses.

```bash
# Load seed data
[command]
```

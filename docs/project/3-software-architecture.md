## Tech Stack

> List the main technologies used, with a brief rationale for each choice.

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | [Framework/Library] | [Why] |
| Backend | [Framework/Runtime] | [Why] |
| Database | [DB engine] | [Why] |
| Auth | [Auth solution] | [Why] |
| Hosting | [Platform] | [Why] |
| CI/CD | [Tool] | [Why] |

## Key Architectural Decisions

> Document the major design decisions made (ADR-style, but informal). Include the context, the decision, and the consequences.

### [Decision 1: e.g., Monorepo vs. Polyrepo]

- **Context**: [Why did this come up?]
- **Decision**: [What was decided?]
- **Consequences**: [What does this enable/constrain?]

## Frontend Architecture

> Describe the frontend structure: component model, state management, routing, styling, design system.

## Backend / API Architecture

> Describe the backend structure: API style (REST/GraphQL/RPC), authentication flow, key services.

## Data Access Layer

> How does the application read/write data? Direct DB calls, ORM, generated clients, etc.

## Security Model

> Describe the security model: where authorization is enforced, how authentication works, key security principles.

## Environment Strategy

> How are environments structured (local / staging / production)? What varies per environment?

| Environment | Purpose | URL / Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Local | Development | localhost |
| Staging / Dev | Team testing | [URL] |
| Production | Live users | [URL] |

## External Integrations

> List third-party services integrated with the product.

| Service | Purpose | Notes |

| [Service] | [Purpose] | [Notes] |

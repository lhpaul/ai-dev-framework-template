# Claude Code Command: Run Item

`/run-item` is the **canonical single-item bounded command**. It runs the shared
bounded prelude before any mutation, then advances exactly one non-epic item
through Protocol 91 until a real terminal condition.

`/run-item-work` is a deprecated compatibility alias with identical behavior.

## Bounded prelude and Protocol 91

Run the shared bounded prelude and single-item loop per
`docs/workflow/development-workflow/bounded-run-prelude.md` and Protocol 91
(`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`).
The prelude command flags mirror this command's scope flags (`--target`, `--issue`,
`--branch`, `--pr`, `--development`, policy overrides, `--json`).

- Print `policyRecommendation.confirmationSummary` before mutation, including
  effective policy, field sources, pending checkpoint guidance, copy-paste
  equivalent, and the read-only guarantee.
- After explicit autonomy flags or human acceptance, record the
  invocation-scoped `RUN_ITEM_POLICY_CONFIRMED` item/policy binding and do not
  re-prompt for the same selected policy.
- Pending checkpoints, guardrail stops, review/CI failures, risk violations, and
  missing permissions still stop the run.
- Resolve exactly one non-epic workflow item
- Use `scripts/development-workflow/` helpers for next-action classification
- In `workflow_hub`, state product repository and mutation target before implementation mutation
- Continue until waiting on human, blocked, or escalated
- If delegated merge authority is active and the merge gate returns
  `merge_allowed`, continue through merge, branch cleanup,
  `post-merge-cleanup.sh`, and live tracker verification before reporting
  terminal
- Epic-like targets → use `/run-epic` instead
